# Cars4U_Pricing_Analysis

### Background
Cars4U is a budding tech start-up that aims to break into the pre-owned cars market. Unlike new cars whose prices are certain, various factors determine the 
price of pre-owned cars and it is important to be able to predict the prices for a chance to grow in the market.

This project aims to analyse the available data on used cars, build a linear regression model to effectively predict their prices, and generate insights and 
recommendations that will help the business devise profitable strategies.
